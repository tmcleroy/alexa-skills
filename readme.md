### how to build
- be in the directory of the skill you want to build
- `zip -r bundle.zip ./`
- upload that zip as your lambda

### notes
Each skill directory has a `schema.txt` and `utterances.txt`. Those should be pasted into the interaction model fields when setting up the skill in the Amazon developer console.
